# ***1. MAX-SAT solver***

- Description:

  This code solves a MAX-SAT problem which means that it tries to count the number of satisfied binary clauses between the given clauses.

  Also this code gives the exact value of each variables which are satisfying the maximum clauses.

- Sample Input:

  number_of_variables,  number_of_clauses  clauses in order, finished with 0, '-' means "NOT"
  
  ```
  5 3
  1 2 3 0
  -1 -4 0
  4 -3 0
  ```
 - Sample Output:
 
   ```
   3
   10000
   ```
